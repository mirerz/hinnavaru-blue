# Doc Reverse-Sync: EPIC-1000

> **Epic**: [EPIC-1000 — Epic Title](../epics/EPIC-1000/EPIC-1000.md)
> **Purpose**: Update existing docs to reflect what was ACTUALLY built, not what was planned.
> Copy to `docs/sdlc/epics/EPIC-1000/DOC-REVERSE-SYNC.md`

## Why Reverse-Sync?

PRD and Tech Design describe what we PLANNED. Implementation often deviates:
- API response shape changed during backend collaboration
- UI flow simplified after testing on device
- Edge case handling added that wasn't in the original spec
- Scope cut due to time or complexity

Docs must reflect reality, not the plan.

## Step 1: Compare Plan vs Reality

| Aspect | Planned (PRD/Tech Design) | Actually Built | Delta |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------|-------|
| User flow | | | Same / Changed |
| API endpoints | | | Same / Changed |
| Data models | | | Same / Changed |
| Error handling | | | Same / Changed |
| UI/screens | | | Same / Changed |
| Scope delivered | | | Full / Partial |

## Step 3: Update Epic Artifacts

| Artifact | Needs Update? | What Diverged | Done |
|----------|--------------|---------------|------|
| PRD (acceptance criteria) | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No | | ⬜ |
| Tech Design (file list, API) | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No | | ⬜ |
| Test Plan (new cases added) | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No | | ⬜ |

## Step 4: Claude-Assisted Doc Update

> For each doc that needs updating, use this prompt:

```
Read the current doc at docs/[XX-doc-name].md and the implementation 
in [list of changed files from PR]. Generate updated sections that
reflect what was actually built for epic EPIC-1000. Only change 
sections affected by this epic. Keep existing doc structure and style.
```
