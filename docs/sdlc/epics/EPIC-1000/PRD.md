## 1. Problem

_What user problem or business need does this solve?_

## 2. Goal

_What does success look like? Include measurable outcomes._

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| | | |

---

## 3. User Flow

_Step-by-step flow from user's perspective. Reference existing flows from [11-screen-transitions-flow-use-cases-acceptance.md](../../11-screen-transitions-flow-use-cases-acceptance.md) where applicable._

```
Screen A → [Action] → Screen B → [Action] → Screen C
```

### Happy Path
1. User does X
2. App shows Y
3. User confirms Z

### Error / Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Network lost during upload | Show retry dialog, queue locally |
| Camera permission denied | Show settings deep-link prompt |
| Token expired mid-flow | Silent refresh via interceptor, retry request |
| App backgrounded during X | Preserve state, resume on foreground |

## 6. Mobile-Specific Considerations

> Check all that apply and fill in details.

- [ ] **Camera**: Shot type? Resolution? Flash? Volume-button shutter?
- [ ] **Permissions**: Which permissions needed? First-time vs denied flow?
- [ ] **Offline**: What happens without network? Queue? Cache? Error?
- [ ] **Background/Foreground**: State preservation? Upload continuation?
- [ ] **Device Compatibility**: Minimum device? iOS 16.6 specific issues?
- [ ] **Performance**: Memory budget? Startup time impact? Battery?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: VoiceOver labels? Dynamic Type support?
